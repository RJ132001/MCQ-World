Data Science MCQ

The design is the process of using data to find solutions/ to predict outcomes of a problem statement. 

It is also known as data-driven science and is an interdisciplinary field about scientific methods and processes and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms of the structured or unstructured.

There are mainly 5 stages for the data science process:

Understanding business problem

Data collection

Data cleaning and Exploration

Model building

Collect insights

 

Artificial intelligence, Machine learning, and Deep learning are a part of data science.

Machine learning is the Science of Getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed.  Machine learning works on a simple concept that is understanding with experiences.

The primary aim of machine learning is to allow computers to learn automatically without human interaction.

Types of machine learning:

Supervised learning:

in supervised learning, given training explain examples of Input and corresponding output, the machine can predict outputs for new inputs

in supervised learning, we train the images concerning data that is well labeled and with the correct output

 

Unsupervised learning:

Unsupervised learning deals with the unlabeled data

No training data set is provided which means, no training will be given to the machine. Therefore it must work on its own to discover the required information.

The machine is trained with unlabelled data.

 

Artificial Intelligence is one of the booming fields in the computer science field, which is bringing about a global revolution by making intelligent machines. It is currently all around us in the modern world and is making an entry into every field ranging from playing chess to robotics, to self-driving cars, to proving mathematical theorems.

 Artificial Intelligence is made up of 2 words Artificial meaning “Man-Made” and Intelligence meaning “power to think”, making it a “man-made thinking machine”. The end goal of Artificial Intelligence is to make a machine that can think like humans and make decisions based on certain factors. 

Goals of Artificial Intelligence:

The main goals Artificial Intelligence aims to achieve are as follows:

Solve knowledge-intensive tasks.

Replicate human intelligence to make meaningful decisions.

Building a machine that can perform tasks that usually require human intelligence.

Build a machine that demonstrates intelligent behavior and is capable of learning new stuff from past data/experiences.
