Artificial Intelligence MCQ

Artificial Intelligence is one of the booming fields in the computer science field, which is bringing about a global revolution by making intelligent machines. It is currently all around us in the modern world and is making an entry into every field ranging from playing chess to robotics, to self-driving cars, to proving mathematical theorems.

Artificial Intelligence is made up of 2 words Artificial meaning “Man-Made” and Intelligence meaning “power to think”, making it a “man-made thinking machine”. The end goal of Artificial Intelligence is to make a machine that can think like humans and make decisions based on certain factors.

Goals of Artificial Intelligence:

The main goals Artificial Intelligence aims to achieve are as follows:

Solve knowledge-intensive tasks.

Replicate human intelligence to make meaningful decisions.

Building a machine that can perform tasks that usually require human intelligence.

Build a machine that demonstrates intelligent behavior and is capable of learning new stuff from past data/experiences.
